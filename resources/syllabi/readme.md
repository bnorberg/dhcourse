### Syllabi

Here you will find the syllabus that is represented of the assignments, activities, and readings we found most effective for the widest amount of undergraduates. But we have also included folders that contains the syllabi from two Marist DH courses as an example of how the materials in the repository can be used in a pick-and-chose fashion to meet the needs and requirements of different types of classes. One of these syllabi is for an upper-level undergraduate course that is structured around one large group project and blog posts throughout the weeks. The other syllabi is for a lower-level course that has several larger graded assignements, include an individual project assignment, and has less formal weekly discussions.
