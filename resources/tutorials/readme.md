### Tutorials

In this section we provide access to all the tutorials created for the digital humanities course. These tutorials are separated by themes. Sometimes themes will match one to one with weeks in the course, such as the Mapping and GIS tutorials showing up in the mapping_gis theme folder. Other times tutorials are thrown together in a larger theme folder, such as the text analysis and networks tutorials showing up in the visualization theme folder. We've included tutorials for setting up a WordPress blog in the blogging folder, for those who chose to require discussion assignments be done through blogging.

You also can find the tutorials used each week by going to that week's folder and clicking on the tutorial folder.
