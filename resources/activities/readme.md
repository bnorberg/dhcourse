### Activities

Here you will find the week to week activities for the digital humanities course. These activities includes both discussion and hands-on activities. Some weeks have both kinds of activities, whereas other weeks only have a discussion or hands-on activity. If you are teaching an upper-level course, we advice that the discussions be made more formal by requiring a 300 word discussion post or blog. In the lower-level course we have found it more successful to make these activities informal class discussions for participation points.
