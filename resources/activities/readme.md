### Activities

This section includes the week to week discussion and hands-on activities for the digital humanities course. If you are teaching an upper-level course, we suggest that the discussions be made more formal by requiring a 300-word discussion post or blog. In lower-level courses, we have found it more successful to make these activities informal class discussions for participation points.
