### Assignments Breakdown

In the lower-level assignments students are asked to produce several essays throughout the semester that get them thinking critically about digital humanities before they complete a smaller, individual DH project using [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) for the final assignment. The course also includes a take-home exam.
