## Marist Archives and Special Collections Digital Humanities Course

This repository contains materials from online and on-ground digital humanities courses taught at [Marist College](https://www.marist.edu/). This is a no-coding, undergraduate DH course, optimized for small liberal arts colleges with limited resources to support digital humanities.

The course has been updated and tweaked over the past few years, as well as taught in various formats to different levels of undergraduates. Materials from those courses have been collected and organized into a 15-week structure of lessons and units that include readings, slides, activities, and tutorials. We've created a syllabus built upon this 15-week sturcture, but we have also included the [syllabi](https://github.com/marist-asc/dhcourse/tree/master/resources/syllabi) from the various DH courses at Marist as examples of how parts of these materials can be used to meet the needs and requirements of different classes. These materials are presented here so other instructors can pick and choose materials that work best for their classes.

The course is organized into 4 units over the 15 weeks:
