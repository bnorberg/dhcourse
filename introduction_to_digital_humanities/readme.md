### Introduction to Digital Humanities (DH)

This is a 2-week lesson in which students are introduced to the broad field of humanities, and the digital humanities in particular, including its history from its origins in the late 1940s up to todayâ€™s savvy and topical projects. Week 1 introduces students to the early years of digital humanities, and how it grew out of the Humanities research practices and differs from them. Week 2 walks students through the growth of DH to include new materials of study, new forms of scholarship, and new engagements with technology and power structures.
