### Week 2 - History of Digital Humanities

This week, students will explore the history of digital humanities by, first, looking at some early DH projects and identifying the types of content and tools they use, then learning about some of the issues that arise as the field starts to grow and how that defines some of the features of what we call the "second wave" of DH.

The week includes a hands-on activity in which students work in groups to explore the [Slave Voyages](https://www.slavevoyages.org/) project, comparing the project's first iteration (as seen with the Internet Archives' Wayback machine) to its current state to understand the lifecycle of a DH project and how these projects change over time.
