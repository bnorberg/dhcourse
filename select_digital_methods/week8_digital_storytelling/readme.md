### Week 8 - Digital Storytelling

This week, students begin to think about how their final projects might be composed as they learn about a plethora of website technologies and web tools for presenting digital storytelling. The technologies introduced in this week are organized by the kind of stories one can tell: narrative, spatial, temporal, or graphic. The week ends with students looking at a selection of digital stories and conceptualizing how they might use some of the tools explored during the week to transform the information in these stories.
