### Week 8 - Digital Storytelling

In this week, students will begin to think about how their final projects might be composed as they learn about a plethora website technologies and web tools for presenting digital storytelling. Students will be introduced to these technologies the kind of stories they want to tell: narrative, spatial, temporal, or graphic. The week ends with them looking at digital stories and conceptualizing how they might use some of the tools we looked at to tell the story differently.
