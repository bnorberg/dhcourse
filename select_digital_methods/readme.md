### Select Digital Methods

This is a 6-week lesson that gives students an introductory walkthough of a few common methods used in digital humanities. Week 1 focuses on digital storytelling to introduce a core purpose of digital humanities projects and provide tools and examples for how they might present their final projects. Week 1 also acts a very light introduction to the methods that will be discussed in following weeks. Week 2 introduces how visualization is used and thought about in digital humanities, as well as acts as critical framework for thinking about the methods the class will explore in the following weeks. Week 3 has students look at how maps are used in digital humanities projects and introduces some basic GIS concpets and practices. In week 4 and 5, the students learn about cultural analytics and basic text analysis and topic modeling. Week 6 exposes students to network analysis and introduces them to various tools for analyzing the interdepence of their information under investigation.

In this section the fun begins: we explore a select set of free tools through lessons, tutorials, and small assignments. Remember, we specialize here in “no code” tools that will allow us to dive in unweighted by tech requirements. Here's some tools we will look at:

[Juxtapose JS](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/): Web-based tool for making frame comparisons (photographs, images)
[Kumu](https://kumu.io/): Web-based tool for creating networks
[Storymap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/): Web-based tool for maing maps that tell stories
[Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/): Web-based tool for making interactive timelines
[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/): Web-based tool for exploratory text analysis
