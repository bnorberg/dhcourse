### Week 9 - Visualization

In this week, the students will be exposed to how  digital humanists are exposing visualization as a rhetorical act instead of the scientic perspective that sees it as a neutral representation of natural phenomena. Students will learn about concepts like "capta" and work through various activities like thinking about how Google Maps makes users "see" the world in a certain way.
