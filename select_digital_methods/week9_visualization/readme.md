### Week 9 - Visualization

This week, students explore how digital humanists are exposing visualization as a rhetorical act instead of the scientific perspective that sees it as a neutral representation of natural phenomena. Students will learn about concepts, like "capta", and work through various activities, such as thinking about how Google Maps forces users to "see" the world in a certain way.
