### Week 11-12 - Distant Reading

This is a 2-week lesson meant to introduce students to the concept of "distant reading" and how it develops out of the Humanities practice of "close reading". In the first week of the lesson, students read about the Google Book project and experiment with the [Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) tool as they learn about Cultural Analytics. Week 2 gets students thinking about how computers read texts and they finish the week by doing some exploratory text analysis with [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/).
