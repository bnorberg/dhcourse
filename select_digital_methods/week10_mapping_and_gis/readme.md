### Week 8 - Mapping and GIS

In this week, students will first learn the difference between using maps to tell a story and using maps to do GIS analysis. Next, students learn some basic GIS terms and easier to learn web-based tools for doing GIS analysis. Students finish the week by applying what they learned to create a [Google My Map](https://www.google.com/mymaps) that shows users how they see their campus.
