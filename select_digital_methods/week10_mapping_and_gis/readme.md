### Week 10 - Mapping and GIS

This week, students examine the difference between using maps to tell a story and using maps to do GIS analysis. Students begin the week by learning some basic GIS terms, then they get hands-on experience with web-based tools for doing GIS analysis. Students finish the week by applying what they learned to create a [Google My Map](https://www.google.com/mymaps) that shows users how they see their campus.
