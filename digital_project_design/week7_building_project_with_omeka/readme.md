### Week 7 - Building Project with Omeka

This week is dedicated to the students putting into practice what they learned about creating and working with "Humanities data" and project design by building an [Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/) archive containing graffiti posts on Instagram. The students will read about archives and Omeka, then work collaboratively to create the archive in a hands-on activity.
