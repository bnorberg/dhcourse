### Week 5 - Social Media & Data Ethics

This week, students examine a treasure trove of "Humanites Data": social media. Students will get experience collect data from Twitter with the [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/) tool, but not before they are exposed to the darker side of the internet with regard to social media, “smart” devices, corporate control, lack of privacy, and related issues. 

After watching a few TED talks to generate conversation about the ethical issues of using large, aggregate datasets (sometimes refer to "big data"), students will get practice in ethically working with data through a hands-on activity using grounded theory to code a set of tweets.
