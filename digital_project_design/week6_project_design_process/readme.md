### Week 6 - Project Design Process (Prototyping) 

This week students will read about "design thinking" as they are introduced a method for approaching digital projects. They will learn about protoyping and what tools are particularly good for prototyping DH projects. The second half of the week will be spent looking at a particular tool for prototyping, [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) and discussion about how we can analyze existing DH projects as a means to improve our prototyping skills.
