### Week 6 - Project Design Process (Prototyping) 

This week, students will read about "design thinking" as they are introduced to a method for approaching digital projects. They will learn about prototyping and what tools are particularly good for prototyping DH projects. The second half of the week will be spent looking at a specific tool for prototyping, [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/), and the week will conclude with a discussion about how students can analyze existing DH projects as a means to improving their prototyping skills.
