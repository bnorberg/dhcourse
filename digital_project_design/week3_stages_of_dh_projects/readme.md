### Stages of Digital Project

In this week, students learn about the 3 stages of a digital humanities project: collection, analysis, and publication. They will develop skills for breaking DH projects into parts and asking questions to effectively navigate through each stage.

This week includes several hands-on ativities in which students will gain experience structure information into usuable data and structuring data for analysis, as well as a discussion activity that gets them thinking critically about tool selections.
