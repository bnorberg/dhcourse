### Digital Project Design

This is a 5-week lesson that introduces students to the steps of doing a digital project. Week 1 focuses students on the stages of a project: collection, anaylsys, and publication. The next 3 weeks exposes students to resources and tools for fiding and publishing their digital research (more in depth discussion of analysis is saved for the next lesson - Select Digital Methods), as well as getting students to think about the ethical ramifications of the information they use in their digital projects. The final week in the lesson is deticated to getting studetns practice with building a project using [Omeka](https://omeka.org/).
